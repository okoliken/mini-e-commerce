This project is a four-page iOS application inspired by a design I found on Figma Community. While building it, I gained valuable experience working with Swift, SwiftUI, and SwiftData for data persistence.

Throughout the development process, I focused on writing clean, reusable code and applied several core Swift concepts, including:

Creating reusable views

Implementing functional and sorting logic

Extending settings and navigation views

Working with and manipulating large JSON datasets

Overall, this project showcases my understanding of fundamental Swift and SwiftUI principles and how to apply them in building a functional iOS application.
